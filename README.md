# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The player has to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## How to Play

1. The game will choose a random word from a predefined list.
2. A percentage of the letters in the word will be hidden.
3. The player will have a limited number of attempts to guess the letters or the entire word.
4. If the player guesses a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If the player guesses the word correctly or reveals all letters before running out of attempts, they win.
6. If the player runs out of attempts, they lose.
